## Administration

The personal admin site exists for you, your staff, or your clients to create, edit, and delete published material. The admin site isn't intended to be used by site visitors.

You can create an admin user with:

```shell

python manage.py createsuperuser

```

You can login to the Django admin site at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) with your user name and password.
