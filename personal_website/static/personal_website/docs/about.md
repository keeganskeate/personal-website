My name is Keegan Skeate and I am an economist, software developer, and data scientist. I have even worked as a laboratory analyst performing a wide range of analyses on cannabis. I have earned two master's in economics, one from the [University of North Carolina, Charlotte](https://www.uncc.edu/) and the second from the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). My career objective is to systematically contribute ideas, knowledge, and skills to help create and build meaningful projects, tools, and systems.


## Story

I started my education as a business student at [AB Tech](https://abtech.edu/) in Asheville, North Carolina. A great finance instructor inspired me to apply to UNC Charlotte, where I was accepted and decided to major in economics. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Economics and summa cum laude (with a 4.0 GPA) through diligent work.

Next, I applied to applied to UNC Charlotte's [graduate school](https://graduateschool.uncc.edu/). I was accepted and earned a Masters in Economics in record-time by writing a master's thesis while taking coursework.

I then applied and was accepted into the University of California, Irvine Ph.D. in Economics program. I excelled in microeconomics and econometrics, earning top-marks on the microeconomic comprehensive exam and was awarded the [Judges' Winner in Economics]((https://symposium.ags.uci.edu/2016-winners-abstracts/)) at the 2016 Graduate Student Symposium. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your perspective, I did not pass the macroeconomic comprehensive exam and my education concluded with a second masters in economics.


## Education

I earned a B.S. in Economics from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in May of 2014. While earning my bachelor's degree, I began learning how to estimate economic models and forecast with SAS and Stata. After three years of study, I graduated Summa Cum Laude.

I earned a M.S. in Economics from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in June 2015. I began learning the Python programming language and applying it to solve problems in advanced computational economics. From demonstrating proficiency in economics, I was invited and accepted into [Omicron Delta Epsilon](http://www.omicrondeltaepsilon.org/): The International Economics Honor Society. I completed my first master's degree by defending a [master's thesis](http://gradworks.umi.com/15/98/1598090.html) on tax policies for charitable donations.

I earned a M.A. in Economics from the University of California at Irvine in December 2016. During my graduate studies, I wrote Bayesian algorithms, fit advanced economic models, and forecasted outcomes with Python, MATLAB, and Stata. I also presented a working paper at UC Irvine's 2016 Associated Graduate Students Symposium and was awarded the [Judge's Winner in Economics](https://symposium.ags.uci.edu/2016-winners-abstracts/).

During my graduate studies, I wrote [a master's thesis](../static/personal_website/pdfs/thesis.pdf) that examines how families change their charitable giving behavior in response to charitable donations made by their reference group members. I also gave an award-winning economics presentation on charitable giving.


## Teaching Experience

When I was a graduate student, I has served as teaching assistant for several fantastic professors and courses.

- Professor Ellen Sewell's Principles of Microeconomics, Intermediate Microeconomics, and Industrial Organization and Public Policy
- Professor Amihai Glazer's Corporate Governance
- Professor Jiawei Chen's Intermediate Economics I
- Professor Brian C. Jenkins' Intermediate Economics III


## Research Experience

I aided Professor Paul Gaggl in his research on the distributional effect on wages from electricity adoption in the early 20th century and assisted Professor Ellen Sewell in her research on fixed book price laws in Europe and the theoretical welfare implications of resale price maintenance. I also conducted original research on the motivations for families in the United States to give to charity.


## Finance Experience<a id="experience"></a>

I have completed two professional internships. First, I helped to implement an enterprise software system for [Kimbrell's Furniture](https://kimbrells.com/) that manages more than $40 million in accounts receivable and $8 million in inventory for their 45 retail locations in 3 states.

Second, I found cost-saving vendor opportunities in the purchasing department of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte as a spend analyst by utilizing an industry-specific analytics program. I compiled data, performed data analysis, and charted trends in commodity prices, helping senior purchasing agents make optimal vendor choices.


## Analyst Experience

I started as a Laboratory Analyst at Praxis Laboratory and The Institute of Food Safety and Defense where I conducted analyses on a wide reange of cannabis products. In April of 2018, I was promoted to Software Developer. In January of 2020, Data Scientist was added to my title.

As a software developer, I developed a laboratory information management system (LIMS) application that collects, analyzes, and reports data for more than 80,000 laboratory tests per year, as well as a client portal web application that more than 300 cannabis producers and processors use to access their laboratory results. I automated all interactions with the Washington State cannabis traceability system and the majority of routine or administrative laboratory tasks, including scheduling, sample reception, data collection and analysis, certificate creation, and result reporting.

Additionally, I created weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports to provide detailed statistics of all laboratory testing data collected and interpretations of trends, patterns, and key performance indicators.


## Current projects

Currently, I am working on websites, apps, and graphic design with many great tools, including Python, Flutter, and the web stack. Please explore the following works in progress:
