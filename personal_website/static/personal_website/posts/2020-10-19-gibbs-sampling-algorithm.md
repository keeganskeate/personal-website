# Gibbs Sampling Algorithm

People often face hierarchical choices, such as products of varying quality, but are contrained by their resources. Given observed choices between three ranked alternatives, you can use Gibbs sampling with data augmentation to fit an ordered probit model. This Bayesian procedure generates a probability distribution for the model parameters. Businesses may find this model useful for predicting the likelihood of customers choosing low, medium, or premium grade products.
